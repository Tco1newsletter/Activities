          "Shine like sparkles, Glow like Candles and burn the negativity with crackles"
          It is important to make our children believe that light outshines the darkness and good always triumphs over
          evil. To imbibe this value and to rejoice in the festivities, The Class of One celebrated the occasion of
          Diwali on 19th October, Wednesday. Traditional dressing, snacks party, Diwali crafts, and games were the
          highlights of the day.
          We were delighted to see our kids with their chef caps on, donning their aprons with rolled up sleeves and
          making lip-smacking chaat, with us, live!

          family and friends. Children enjoyed the celebration with full energy. Games and music was organised for the
          students to have a fun filled experience. We all munched together, played pictionary and crossword puzzles
          together and last but not the least singing on the tunes of Christmas carols brought abundant joy and
          happiness in the class.

          MERRY CHRISTMAS
          The festival of love, caring and sharing came alive at The Class of One on 23rd December 2022 when our
          students conducted a special assembly on Christmas. It was a fun- filled day with dance, christmas craft and
          game sessions. Students from different cultures participated in the celebration singing of Christmas carols in
          a cheerful spirit. During the festive time, the students dedicated Christmas messages to their loved ones.
          Some shared their year-end reflections while others indulged in optimistic mood for new year’s resolutions!
